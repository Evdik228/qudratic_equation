### Detailed visual solution of the equation
## 1 Equation and answer
>$x^2 - 7x + 10$  â€” The required equation.

First root: $(\textbf{x = 2)}$.
Second root: $(\textbf{x = 5)}$.

## 2 Solving
> First, let's analyze the coefficient a, it is greater than zero, therefore we will solve the quadratic equation. 
Let's calculate the discriminant!

$$D = b^2 - 4ac$$

In our case: $a = 1$ ,  $b = -7$ , $c = 10$ , hence $\Rightarrow$

$$D = (-7)^2 - 4*1*10 = 9$$

$D > 0 \Rightarrow$ Let's calculate the roots of the quadratic equation using the formula $x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{D}}{2a}$

$$x_{1,2} = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{9}}{2 * 1}$$

>Let's write down the \textbf{roots} of the desired equation
$$x_1 = 2 $$ 
$$x_2 = 5 $$
