### Detailed visual solution of the equation
 ## 1 Equation and answer
>$1.00*x^2 - 2.00x + -3.00$  â€” The required equation.
 - First root: $(\textbf{x = 1.00)}$.
 - Second root: $(\textbf{x = -3.00)}$.
## 2 Solving
 > First, let's analyze the coefficient a, it is not equal to zero, therefore we will solve the quadratic equation. Let's calculate the discriminant!
$$D = b^2 - 4ac$$
In our case: $a = 1.00$ ,  $b = 2.00$ , $c = -3.00$ , hence $\Rightarrow$
 $$D = (2.00)^2 - 4*1.00*-3.00 = 16.00$$
$D > 0 \Rightarrow$ Let's calculate the roots of the quadratic equation using the formula $x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{D}}{2a}$
$$x_{1,2} = \frac{-(2.00) \pm \sqrt{16.00}}{2 * 1.00}$$
>Let's write down the roots of the desired equation
$$x_1 = 1.00 $$ 
$$x_2 = -3.00 $$
